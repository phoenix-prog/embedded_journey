# Embedded Systems Journey

## Purpose
This repository documents my structured, execution-focused journey toward senior-level
embedded and hardware systems engineering.

The focus is on:
- Bare-metal firmware (ARM Cortex-M)
- Hardware design and board bring-up
- Signal integrity and power integrity fundamentals
- Cortex-A system understanding (boot chains, Linux fundamentals)
- Engineering judgment through failure analysis

This is not a tutorial repository. It is a public engineering log.

---

## Scope & Principles
- Register-level firmware before HAL
- Hardware understanding before software fixes
- No study without artifacts
- No zero days (scaled effort allowed)
- Documentation is part of the deliverable

---

## Current Focus
**Phase 1: Cortex-M Foundations**
- GPIO, clocking, reset, interrupts
- Deterministic firmware behavior
- Datasheet- and reference-manual-driven development

---

## Repository Structure
/firmware → Bare-metal drivers, experiments, bring-up code
/hardware → Schematics, PCB layouts, bring-up notes
/notes → Technical explanations and applied theory
/debugging → Logs, scope captures, failure analysis

## Learning Stack
Primary:
- Designing Embedded Hardware

Secondary:
- ARM System Developer’s Guide

Reference:
- High-Speed Digital Design (applied selectively)

---

## Weekly Output Rule
Every week must produce at least one of:
- Working firmware with explanation
- Hardware design or review
- Debugging report with evidence
- Applied technical notes

Missed weeks are visible and intentional.

---

## What This Repository Is NOT
- Not a collection of random projects
- Not Arduino-style examples
- Not copy-pasted drivers
- Not optimized for beginners

---

## Status
This repository is actively updated.
Quality and depth are prioritized over speed.
